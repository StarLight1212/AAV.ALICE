## Mapping AAV capsid sequences to functions through in silico function-guided evolution

✨ALICE offers a novel design paradigm for designing protein complexes: AAV capsids, helping researchers to explore the potential AAV capsid space more accurately. It provides new ideas for AI to design protein complexes under limited data conditions. More importantly, it accelerates the development of new serotype capsids in gene therapy.

Key Innovations of ALICE
```
ALICE (AI-driven Ligand-Informed Capsid Engineering) represents a groundbreaking approach to AAV capsid engineering, offering several key innovations:
- [x] 1. Direct in silico design of multifunctional capsids: ALICE achieves direct computational engineering of AAV capsids with multiple functions, independent of in vivo selection processes. While AI has been used to construct capsid libraries with enhanced fitness or diversity, previous approaches still relied on unpredictable in vivo selection. ALICE pioneers the direct in silico design of multifunctional capsids, potentially accelerating AAV-based gene therapy development more efficiently.
- [x] 2. Function-guided evolutionary approach: ALICE overcomes the challenge of fusing multiple functions into a single sequence, a limitation often faced by conventional generative language models. By employing a novel function-guided evolutionary approach, ALICE successfully integrates multiple functions into a single capsid sequence, bridging the gap in AI-driven design of multifunctional AAV capsids and providing insights for other multifunctional protein complexes.
- [x] 3. Interpretable computational mapping of capsid sequence to function: ALICE demonstrates an interpretable approach to mapping capsid sequences to multiple functions. By illustrating multi-level relationships between capsid sequences and functions, ALICE enables knowledge-driven AAV design. This approach offers insights into the interpretability, controllability, and safety of viral capsid protein engineering, addressing crucial bio-security concerns in the field.

## Usage 
### Please access and download the relevant data from the following Google Drive link:

  > [ALICE Data Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vHAZe2p-mq58dbaS-pdC5AtfR12eYMDX?usp=sharing)

    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vHAZe2p-mq58dbaS-pdC5AtfR12eYMDX?usp=sharing

Upon downloading, ensure that the acquired "input", "output", and "checkpoint" directories are placed at the same hierarchical level as the "step1_pretrain", "step2_semantic_tuning", and other directories within the ALICE project folder structure. This directory organization is crucial for maintaining the correct relative paths and enabling seamless execution of the ALICE pipeline.


### Step 1: Pretrain Module (directory: step1_pretrain)
This module is used for training and inferencing the RoBERTa pretrain model on UniProt datasets. It provides a solid foundation for understanding protein sequences and their underlying patterns.

#### Key components:
- [x] Data preprocessing of UniProt datasets
- [x] RoBERTa model configuration and initialization
- [x] Training pipeline with masked language modeling objective

### Step 2: Semantic Tuning Module (directory: step2_semantic_tuning)
This module focuses on training and inferencing the RoBERTa-based SeqGAN (Sequence Generative Adversarial Network) model using AAV capsid sequences. It aims to capture the semantic properties of functional capsid sequences.
